The idea of our project is to create an application that will assist victims of any natural or man-made disaster in receiving assistance from the necessary aid centres, influenced by the “911” process used in the United States. As an alternative to making phone calls, we decided to create an application. A mobile application would be suitable in case of busy phone lines, a poor network, a noisy environment, or if the victim was unable to talk due to trauma. We agree that during crises, it is critical that all of the disparate agencies and aid centres, such as hospitals, fire departments, and police stations, are brought together under one umbrella, operate in synchrony, and have accurate ground level information. This information will assist in the study of the most common disasters, the causes of disasters, and the most affected areas, which can help in the prediction and preparedness of disasters in advance, and our application aims to promote this.
